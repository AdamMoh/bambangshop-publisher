## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
1. We still need an interface or trait in this BambangShop case. The interface is needed to define the methods that the subscribers must implement. This way, the publisher can notify the subscribers without knowing the concrete type of the subscribers. This is important because the publisher should not be tightly coupled with the subscribers.

2. DashMap is necessary because we need to access the data based on the unique id. Using Vec will make the access time O(n) that makes it's not efficient while using DashMap will make the access time O(1) that means DashMap more efficient and.

3. Singleton pattern could technically be used in Rust, it doesn't directly address the thread safety concerns that DashMap handles. DashMap provides a more explicit and Rust-like solution for concurrent access to shared data, making it a better fit for ensuring thread safety in this context.



#### Reflection Publisher-2

1. Separating "Service" and "Repository" from the Model in the MVC pattern promotes better code organization, adherence to design principles, improved testability, and enhanced maintainability and flexibility(Single Responsibility Principle) in the long run.

2. Relying solely on the Model without separating concerns into Service and Repository layers could result in increased code complexity for each model. Interactions between models would be more tightly coupled, making the codebase harder to maintain, understand, and extend over time.

3. Postman is a tool for testing the APIs that we made in our application, and Postman also provides a feature to make a collection of requests that we can use to test our application and share to our team members.

#### Reflection Publisher-3
1. It's reasonable to assume that the Push model of the Observer Pattern is being employed, where subscribers are passively notified of updates by the publisher when new programs are added.

2. The Pull model offers the advantage of subscribers retrieving data only when needed, which can be beneficial in reducing unnecessary data transfer and improving efficiency. However, the risk of using stale data is a significant drawback that must be carefully considered.

3. Not using multi-threading in the notification process could lead to sequential processing, blocking behavior, increased latency, scalability issues, and inefficient resource utilization.
